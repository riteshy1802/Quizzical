## Project Description

Quizzical is a fun and engaging trivia game that allows players to test their general knowledge.

After completing the quiz, users receive feedback on their performance, including their score and a breakdown of their answers.

## Configuration

The game uses the Open Trivia Database API to fetch trivia questions. You can customize the number of questions, difficulty level, and type of questions by modifying the API URL in the `Quiz` component:

const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=5&type=multiple');
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    // ...
  }
};
```

- **`amount`**: Specifies the number of questions to fetch.
- **`type`**: Determines the question type (e.g., `multiple`, `boolean`). 
- **`difficulty`**: Sets the difficulty level (e.g., `easy`, `medium`, `hard`).
